	\section*{Introduction}
		This is a brief collection of information regarding the design specification assignment
	\section*{Overview}
		We met as a team and discussed a great deal of what our plans were for
		our project. Overall, it seemed productive.
	\section*{Summary}
		Having the in-class time for discussion, as well as having our scheduled meeting
		on Friday was very helpful. Everyone looked to be paying attention and provided
		helpful input when possible. As for the design specification and our timeline, we came
		to a consensus in that we should focus on building the core of the application before
		anything else.
