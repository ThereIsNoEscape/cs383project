\noindent \textbf{Introduction}
\vspace{2.5mm}

We were tasked as a group to come up with a Design Specification for our tower lights program. The Design Specification includes what we want in our first iteration, what our future iterations will be, and a use case diagram for our first iteration.

\noindent \textbf{Overview}
\vspace{2.5mm}

To start things off, we met as a group to discuss what exactly we wanted in our first iteration of the project. We decided that it would be a good idea to start off simple to get things running. We had three main features we wanted in our first iteration: Be able to open a .tan file, have our program verify if what we opened is/isn't a .tan file, and create/save blank .tan files. These main features will at least lay the foundation for our program to work. We split up the work so that everyone had something to work on. I was tasked with creating the use case diagram for creating a new .tan file. Our idea is that everyone would make a different use case, and then we would piece all of the use cases together to create an overall diagram of our first iteration.

\noindent \textbf{Summary}
\vspace{2.5mm}

Overall this assignment was pretty simple considering it's our first iteration. Coding our first iteration will probably be more difficult than we think. I think it's a good idea that we started simple on the first iteration, just so we can get a basic foundation for our program.

I created the "create new .tan file" use case diagram, which is basic and simple.

This is a rough drawing of what the first iteration would look like.
